{"name":"Libnetfilter conntrack","tagline":"Mirror of https://git.netfilter.org/libnetfilter_conntrack","body":"libnetfilter_conntrack - userspace library for the connection tracking system\r\n(C) 2005-2011 Pablo Neira Ayuso <pablo@netfilter.org>\r\n=============================================================================\r\n\r\n= Connection Tracking System =\r\n\r\nThe connection tracking system is a in-kernel subsystem that stores information\r\nabout the state of a connection in a memory structure that contains the source\r\nand destination IP addresses, port number pairs, protocol types, state, and \r\ntimeout. With this extra information, we can define more intelligent filtering\r\npolicies. \r\n\r\nMoreover, there are some application protocols, such as FTP, TFTP, IRC, PPTP \r\nthat have aspects that are hard to track for a firewall that follows the \r\ntraditional static filtering approach. The connection tracking system defines \r\na mechanism to track such aspects.\r\n\r\nThe connection tracking system does not alter the packets themselves; the \r\ndefault behavior always lets the packets continue their travel through the\r\nnetwork stack, although there are a couple of very specific exceptions where \r\npackets can be dropped (e.g., under memory exhaustion). So keep in mind that \r\nthe connection tracking system just tracks packets; it does not filter.\r\n\r\nFor further information on the connection tracking system, please see the\r\nreference section at the bottom of this document.\r\n\r\n= What is libnetfilter_conntrack? =\r\n\r\nlibnetfilter_conntrack is an userspace library that provides an interface to \r\nthe in-kernel connection tracking system.\r\n\r\n= License =\r\n\r\nlibnetfilter_conntrack is released under GPLv2 or any later at your option.\r\n\r\n= Prerequirements for libnetfilter_conntrack =\r\n\r\nLinux kernel version >= 2.6.18 (http://www.kernel.org) and enable support for:\r\n\r\n * connection tracking system (quite obvious ;)\r\n * nfnetlink\r\n * ctnetlink (ip_conntrack_netlink)\r\n * connection tracking event notification API \r\n\r\n= Documentation =\r\n\r\nYou can generate the doxygen-based documentation by invoking:\r\n\t$ doxygen doxygen.cfg\r\n\r\n= Examples =\r\n\r\nYou can find a set of handy examples on the use of libnetfilter_conntrack \r\nunder the directory utils/ distributed with this library. You can compile them\r\nby invoking:\r\n\t$ make check\r\n\r\n= Heads Up =\r\n\r\nlibnetfilter_conntrack used to provided two different APIs: The old one had\r\nseveral limitations, for that reason, it was deprecated time ago. The existing\r\nlibrary only provides the new API that solves former deficiencies. Thus, make\r\nsure you use recent versions of libnetfilter_conntrack and, in case that\r\nyou are using the old API, consider porting your application to the new one.\r\n\r\nSince libnetfilter_conntrack >= 0.9.1, you can use the same handler obtained\r\nvia nfct_open() to register conntrack and expectation callbacks (before this\r\nversion, this was not possible).\r\n\r\n= References =\r\n\r\n[1] Pablo Neira Ayuso.
